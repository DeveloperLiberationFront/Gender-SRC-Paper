Because security must be designed in, static analysis should occur early in software development to reduce vulnerabilities or, even better, provide feedback to educate software developers and reinforce good practices, minimizing vulnerable constructs ever getting in the code. Even as industry migrates to languages safer than unconstrained C, thus eliminating many possible weaknesses, static analysis can be even more useful to check annotations, guarantees, conditions, and specifications provided by developers.},
