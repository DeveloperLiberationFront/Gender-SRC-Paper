\begin{abstract}
  Female software developers account for only a small portion of the total
  developer community. This inequality is caused by subtle beliefs and 
  sometimes interactions between different genders and society,
  referred to as implicit biases and explicit behavior, respectively.
  In this study, I mined user contribution acceptance from a popular software collaboration
  service. The contributions of female developers
  were accepted into open-source projects with roughly equivalent success to
  those of males, partially discounting recent findings that explicit behavior
  accompanies implicit gender bias, while bolstering the claim that implicit bias is
  cultural, rather than as a result of innate differences.

\section{Problem and Motivation}

It is well documented that women are underrepresented in technical fields:
42\% of all doctoral degrees in science, technology, education, and
math (STEM) are earned by women, and only 28\% of tenure-track faculty in these
fields are women \cite{womenengineering}. Jackson et al. claims that implicit
bias and explicit behavior are main
factors of this finding \citep{implicitbias}. In this paper, I
contribute the first preliminary investigation of these factors of gender bias
by answering the following.

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{Research Question -} Does online collaboration on GitHub result in
  explicit behavior which may be caused by the implicit biases surrounding
  gender?
\end{quote}

I use data mining techniques to help answer this question, while also creating
more questions for further study surrounding the results.

\section{Background and Related Work}

Many human cultures perceive female contribution to technical
fields as inappropriate due to religious or culturally constructed attitudes, with
negligible rationale \citep{elamin2010saudiwomen}. This has contributed to a gross imbalance in gender diversity among
the most technical computing and engineering fields, frustrating economic,
scientific, and innovative pursuits \citep{genderscience}.

The resulting inefficiencies in overall creativity and technical expertise
can be a severe handicap to any society, notwithstanding universal human rights
violations; by any modern ethical theory, human females are due equal
consideration as human males \citep{ethicsgender}.

Under-appreciation of an individual or group in a certain
discipline can discourage that group's contributions, further enforcing a
constructed bias for that discipline; software development is an example of such
a field \citep{genderscience}.

In 2005-2006, women accounted for only 20.6\% of awarded computer and information
science undergraduate degrees, according to the National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES), while women earned 52\% of all undergraduate
math and science degrees overall \citep{genderdiversitycomputing}.
Sax et al. claims that there is some evidence of improvement, with female
undergraduate computer and information science students composing only 13.6\% of
their classes on average in 1971, the minimum recorded, and presently 18.2\%, a
25\% increase according to the NCES. The highest ratio of female students,
37.1\% was recorded in 1984 \citep{evolutionofwomen}.
This underrepresented population is a problem because of the great demand yet
decreasing supply of jobs in this field: by 2018, US universities will only
supply 52\% of the 1.4 million available jobs in computation and information
sciences \citep{genderdiversitycomputing}.

This gender imbalance could be caused by many troubling subtleties,
one potential being the differences, if any, in interactions
between females and males, via any medium \citep{implicitbias}.

These interactions include software 
collaboration. If there are significant explicit behavioral differences in the
treatment given to males and females, then revealing evidence in the overall success of
collaborative project contributions on the open-source Git
repository service, GitHub, may be one indication. The ability to mine this information
presents an interesting ecosystem to observe real user behavior to validate current
literature on implicit bias.

\section{Approach and Uniqueness}

GitHub does not record gender information about its users. Automated gender
determination has recently been achieved \cite{VasilescuIWC13}.
Vasilescu (2014) granted access to user data mined from GHTorrent in November 2014,
along with the gender of all GitHub users up to that date using the process
outlined in Vasilescu (2014). Observation of individual data points in the given
gender data showed inaccuracies. To overcome this challenge, I mined Google+
accounts, which publicly display gender information; GitHub accounts are
associated with email addresses, so joining the sets resulted in user-gender
identification.

Of the \num{2917942} usernames, \num{1868597} were not defined on Google+ and thus
not used for the purposes of this study. Of the remaining, \num{91357} were
female users and \num{957988} were male.

GitHub's contributions are organized in pull requests, complete with a single
user who created the pull request and a status. The status may be open, closed,
or merged. Merged pull requests are seen by this study as a success, and closed
or open pull requests are determined to be non-successful.

In tandem with GHTorrent's GitHub data store to
access user pull request history, the user-gender data allowed the computation of
the ratio of merge success for each gender. This level of intricate user interaction
between varying diverse people groups has never been closely investigated with
respect to implicit bias and explicit behavior until
now. This single data metric encourages a more complete examination to better
understand the results.

The significance in the difference of female to male success is not the most
significant contribution: this study will pioneer this process for user data on
other public collaborative groups online.
On GitHub, there is still much data mining to do to achieve a more complete
picture of why the ecosystem is underrepresented. Further analysis of other
collaboration metrics is advised.

In this study, I use only one source of real-world behavioral data.
Many other collaborative, public environments exist on the Internet, complete
with programmatic access: Wikipedia, Stack Overflow, etc. These other
communities represent different mutually inclusive subgroups of the global
society and can be used to understand behavioral tendencies of those subgroups
towards gender perception.

Due to the politically volatile nature of this and other related data on gender
or diversity distributions in a service's use, many organizations which value
public opinion are apprehensive about advertising gender inequalities. These new data
mining methods advance the reach of social science into non-obtrusive public
ecosystems of the internet without exposing a company's prior knowledge of a
potential issue.

\section{Results and Contributions}

\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Contribution Success by Gender}
    \begin{tabular}{l|r|r}
      & Female & Male\\ \hline
      Pull Requests & \num{197936} & \num{3651803} \\ \hline
      Successful  & \num{88894} & \num{1620304} \\ \hline
      Unsuccessful  & \num{109042} & \num{2031499} \\ \hline
      Success Rate & \num{44.91}\% & \num{44.37}\% \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

I analyzed \num{3849739} pull requests with determined gender information from
\num{1049345} different users. The final contribution success results are shown in Table 1.

While female pull request contributions account for only $5.14\%$ of the total pull
requests submitted in this data set, it is surprising to find that the merge
success rate is nearly equivalent to male success rate. Unequal gender
distribution found in technical fields may yet be worsened by unequal treatment;
however, the public activity of GitHub users, at least until July 2015,
shows no bias in female collaborative success, despite the 8.71\% female
user base represented by that data.

Speculations as to the cause of these results can lead to more detailed studies,
as mentioned previously:
Perhaps female software developers are bolstered by the hardships faced as a
minority, thus increasing their average quality of contribution. If female
contributions are of greater quality than that of males, any discriminatory
action against female contributors may be statistically neutralized. Static
analysis tools could be used on the commit content of each pull request gathered
in this study to determine if a quality-of-work bias occurs between genders
\cite{staticanalysis}; Determining a causal relationship to the skewed merge success rate may be a
challenge, however. Such a study would necessarily relate merge success rate to
pull request quality, with gender as a control.

Another consideration: due to the widespread knowledge of gender inequality in software development,
female developers may choose to anonymize their gender online. This bias would
be very difficult to detect; in this study, users of GitHub whose usernames are
not indicative of a gender were discarded. These users of unknown gender may be
an interesting third gender to consider in all of the above data queries. By
analyzing other indicators, such as the contribution quality, mentioned above,
significant findings may be able to be determined for those users who choose to
avoid gender identification.

Further investigation is required to explore these and other bias indicators. I
advise a comprehensive study to mine and analyze this statistically relevant
information with respect to gender, as well as other categorical information
about users, such as race or ethnicity, which may be used in a similar fashion.
